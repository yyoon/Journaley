   If you already have a journal database created by Journaley or Day One, select "Import Your Journal."  
   Otherwise, select "Start a New Journal."  
   If you import the Day One database from Dropbox, it will automatically be in sync with Journaley.
5. You can optionally set a password to access your journal entries through Journaley.
6. After the initial setup, you will see your existing journal entries (if there's any), or an empty journal.  
   You can add new entries or edit existing ones from now on.
